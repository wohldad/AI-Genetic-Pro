=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides efficient implementation of a genetic algorithm for
professional use. It was designed to operate as fast as possible
even on very large populations and big individuals/chromosomes. C<AI::Genetic::Pro> 
was inspired by C<AI::Genetic>, so it is in most cases compatible 
(there are some changes). Additionally C<AI::Genetic::Pro> isn't a pure Perl solution, so it 
B<doesn't have> limitations of its ancestor (such as serious slow-down in the
case of big populations ( >10000 ) or vectors with more than 33 fields).

If You are looking for a pure Perl solution, consider L<AI::Genetic>.

=over 4

=item Speed

To increase speed XS code is used, however with portability in 
mind. This distribution was tested on Windows and Linux platforms 
(and should work on any other).

=item Memory

This module was designed to use as little memory as possible. A population
of size 10000 consisting of 92-bit vectors uses only ~24MB (C<AI::Genetic> 
would use about 78MB!).

=item Advanced options

To provide more flexibility C<AI::Genetic::Pro> supports many 
statistical distributions, such as C<uniform>, C<natural>, C<chi_square>
and others. This feature can be used in selection and/or crossover. See
the documentation below.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<new>( %options )

Constructor. It accepts options in hash-value style. See options and 
an example below.

=over 8

=item -fitness

This defines a I<fitness> function. It expects a reference to a subroutine.

=item -terminate 

This defines a I<terminate> function. It expects a reference to a subroutine.

=item -type

This defines the type of chromosomes. Currently, C<AI::Genetic::Pro> supports four types:

=over 12

=item bitvector

Individuals/chromosomes of this type have genes that are bits. Each gene can be in one of two possible states, on or off.

=item listvector

Each gene of a "listvector" individual/chromosome can assume one string value from a specified list of possible string values.

=item rangevector

Each gene of a "rangevector" individual/chromosome can assume one integer 
value from a range of possible integer values. Note that only integers 
are supported. The user can always transform any desired fractional values 
by multiplying and dividing by an appropriate power of 10.

=item combination

Each gene of a "combination" individual/chromosome can assume one string value from a specified list of possible string values. B<All genes are unique.>

=back

=item -population

This defines the size of the population, i.e. how many chromosomes
simultaneously exist at each generation.

=item -crossover 

This defines the crossover rate. The fairest results are achieved with
crossover rate ~0.95.

=item -mutation 

This defines the mutation rate. The fairest results are achieved with mutation
rate ~0.01.

=item -preserve

This defines injection of the bests chromosomes into a next generation. It causes a little slow down, however (very often) much better results are achieved. You can specify, how many chromosomes will be preserved, i.e.

    -preserve => 1, # only one chromosome will be preserved
    # or
    -preserve => 9, # 9 chromosomes will be preserved
    # and so on...

Attention! You cannot preserve more chromosomes than exist in your population.

=item -variable_length

This defines whether variable-length chromosomes are turned on (default off)
and a which types of mutation are allowed. See below.

=over 8

=item level 0

Feature is inactive (default). Example:

	-variable_length => 0
	
    # chromosomes (i.e. bitvectors)
    0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
    0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
    0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
    0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0
    # ...and so on

=item level 1 

Feature is active, but chromosomes can varies B<only on the right side>, Example:

	-variable_length => 1
	
    # chromosomes (i.e. bitvectors)
    0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 
    0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
    0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
    0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
    # ...and so on
	
=item level 2 

Feature is active and chromosomes can varies B<on the left side and on 
the right side>; unwanted values/genes on the left side are replaced with C<undef>, ie.
 
	-variable_length => 2
 
    # chromosomes (i.e. bitvectors)
    x x x 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 
    x x x x 0 1 1 1 1
    x 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
    0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
    # where 'x' means 'undef'
    # ...and so on

In this situation returned chromosomes in an array context ($ga-E<gt>as_array($chromosome)) 
can have B<undef> values on the left side (only). In a scalar context each 
undefined value is replaced with a single space. If You don't want to see
any C<undef> or space, just use C<as_array_def_only> and C<as_string_def_only> 
instead of C<as_array> and C<as_string>.

a highway to big trouble. This mode should be used only for testing, because it is B<slow>.

=back

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<inject>($chromosomes)

Inject new, user defined, chromosomes into the current population. See example below:

    # example for bitvector
    my $chromosomes = [
        [ 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1 ],
        [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1 ],
        [ 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0 ],
        ...
    ];
    
    # inject
    $ga->inject($chromosomes);

If You want to delete some chromosomes from population, just C<splice> them:

    my @remove = qw(1 2 3 9 12);
	for my $idx (sort { $b <=> $a }  @remove){
        splice @{$ga->chromosomes}, $idx, 1;
    }

=item C<combination>

Chromosomes will be unique lists of specified values. This is used for example
in the I<Traveling Salesman Problem>. See the documentation of the C<new>
method.

=back

In example:

    my $type = $ga->type();

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<type>()

Alias for C<indType>.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<crossProb>()

This method is used to query and set the crossover rate.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<crossover>()

Alias for C<crossProb>.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<mutProb>()

This method is used to query and set the mutation rate.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<mutation>()

Alias for C<mutProb>.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<parents>($parents)

Set/get number of parents in a crossover.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<init>($args)

This method initializes the population with random individuals/chromosomes. It MUST be called before any call to C<evolve()>. It expects one argument, which depends on the type of individuals/chromosomes:

=over 4

=item B<bitvector>

For bitvectors, the argument is simply the length of the bitvector.

    $ga->init(10);

This initializes a population where each individual/chromosome has 10 genes.

=item B<listvector>

For listvectors, the argument is an anonymous list of lists. The number of sub-lists is equal to the number of genes of each individual/chromosome. Each sub-list defines the possible string values that the corresponding gene can assume.

    $ga->init([
               [qw/red blue green/],
               [qw/big medium small/],
               [qw/very_fat fat fit thin very_thin/],
              ]);

This initializes a population where each individual/chromosome has 3 genes and each gene can assume one of the given values.

=item B<rangevector>

For rangevectors, the argument is an anonymous list of lists. The number of sub-lists is equal to the number of genes of each individual/chromosome. Each sub-list defines the minimum and maximum integer values that the corresponding gene can assume.

    $ga->init([
               [1, 5],
               [0, 20],
               [4, 9],
              ]);

This initializes a population where each individual/chromosome has 3 genes and each gene can assume an integer within the corresponding range.

=item B<combination>

For combination, the argument is an anonymous list of possible values of gene.

    $ga->init( [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] );

This initializes a population where each chromosome has 3 genes and each gene
is a unique combination of 'a', 'b' and 'c'. For example genes looks something
like that:

    [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]    # gene 1
    [ 'c', 'a', 'b' ]    # gene 2
    [ 'b', 'c', 'a' ]    # gene 3
    # ...and so on...

=back

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<evolve>($n)

This method causes the GA to evolve the population for the specified number of
generations. If its argument is 0 or C<undef> GA will evolve the population to
infinity unless a C<terminate> function is specified.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<getHistory>()

Get history of the evolution. It is in a format listed below:

	[
		# gen0   gen1   gen2   ...          # generations
		[ max0,  max1,  max2,  ... ],       # max values
		[ mean,  mean1, mean2, ... ],       # mean values
		[ min0,  min1,  min2,  ... ],       # min values
	]

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<getAvgFitness>()

Get I<max>, I<mean> and I<min> score of the current generation. In example:

    my ($max, $mean, $min) = $ga->getAvgFitness();

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<getFittest>($n, $unique)

This function returns a list of the fittest chromosomes from the current
population.  You can specify how many chromosomes should be returned and if
the returned chromosomes should be unique. See example below.

    # only one - the best
    my ($best) = $ga->getFittest;

    # or 5 bests chromosomes, NOT unique
    my @bests = $ga->getFittest(5);

    # or 7 bests and UNIQUE chromosomes
    my @bests = $ga->getFittest(7, 1);

If you want to get a large number of chromosomes, try to use the
C<getFittest_as_arrayref> function instead (for efficiency).

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<getFittest_as_arrayref>($n, $unique)

This function is very similar to C<getFittest>, but it returns a reference 
to an array instead of a list. 

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<generation>()

Get the number of the current generation.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<people>()

Returns an anonymous list of individuals/chromosomes of the current population. 

B<IMPORTANT:> the actual array reference used by the C<AI::Genetic::Pro> 
object is returned, so any changes to it will be reflected in I<$ga>.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<chromosomes>()

Alias for C<people>.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<chart>(%options)

Generate a chart describing changes of min, mean, and max scores in your
population. To satisfy your needs, you can pass the following options:

=over 4

=item -filename

File to save a chart in (B<obligatory>).

=item -title

Title of a chart (default: I<Evolution>).

=item -x_label

X label (default: I<Generations>).

=item -y_label

Y label (default: I<Value>).

=item -format

Format of values, like C<sprintf> (default: I<'%.2f'>).

=item -legend1

Description of min line (default: I<Min value>).

=item -legend2

Description of min line (default: I<Mean value>).

=item -legend3

Description of min line (default: I<Max value>).

=item -width

Width of a chart (default: I<640>).

=item -height

Height of a chart (default: I<480>).

=item -font

Path to font (in *.ttf format) to be used (default: none).

=item -logo

Path to logo (png/jpg image) to embed in a chart (default: none).

=item For example:

	$ga->chart(-width => 480, height => 320, -filename => 'chart.png');

=back

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<save>($file)

Save the current state of the genetic algorithm to the specified file.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<load>($file)

Load a state of the genetic algorithm from the specified file. 

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<as_array>($chromosome)

In list context return an array representing the specified chromosome. 
In scalar context return an reference to an array representing the specified 
chromosome. If I<variable_length> is turned on and is set to level 2, an array 
can have some C<undef> values. To get only C<not undef> values use 
C<as_array_def_only> instead of C<as_array>.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<as_array_def_only>($chromosome)

In list context return an array representing the specified chromosome. 
In scalar context return an reference to an array representing the specified 
chromosome. If I<variable_length> is turned off, this function is just an
alias for C<as_array>. If I<variable_length> is turned on and is set to 
level 2, this function will return only C<not undef> values from chromosome. 
See example below:

    # -variable_length => 2, -type => 'bitvector'
	
    my @chromosome = $ga->as_array($chromosome)
    # @chromosome looks something like that
    # ( undef, undef, undef, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0 )
	
    @chromosome = $ga->as_array_def_only($chromosome)
    # @chromosome looks something like that
    # ( 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0 )

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<as_string>($chromosome)

Return a string representation of the specified chromosome. See example below:

	# -type => 'bitvector'
	
	my $string = $ga->as_string($chromosome);
	# $string looks something like that
	# 1___0___1___1___1___0 
	
	# or 
	
	# -type => 'listvector'
	
	$string = $ga->as_string($chromosome);
	# $string looks something like that
	# element0___element1___element2___element3...

Attention! If I<variable_length> is turned on and is set to level 2, it is 
possible to get C<undef> values on the left side of the vector. In the returned
string C<undef> values will be replaced with B<spaces>. If you don't want
to see any I<spaces>, use C<as_string_def_only> instead of C<as_string>.

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<as_string_def_only>($chromosome)

Return a string representation of specified chromosome. If I<variable_length> 
is turned off, this function is just alias for C<as_string>. If I<variable_length> 
is turned on and is set to level 2, this function will return a string without
C<undef> values. See example below:

	# -variable_length => 2, -type => 'bitvector'
	
	my $string = $ga->as_string($chromosome);
	# $string looks something like that
	#  ___ ___ ___1___1___0 
	
	$string = $ga->as_string_def_only($chromosome);
	# $string looks something like that
	# 1___1___0 

=item I<$ga>-E<gt>B<as_value>($chromosome)

Return the score of the specified chromosome. The value of I<chromosome> is 
calculated by the fitness function.
